V-12(Complete guide for router and controller with debugging)

we are building logic for routes and debugging
in controller folder we have user controller where we are writing logic(at the moment we have just send a ok massage in response)
ab isi file ka route bhi bana diya "user.routes.js" jis mein hum url deinge jahan humne (/register)ke naam se url daala registerUser(jahan controller pe function likha hay) jab url hit hoga ye usko regiserUser controller se utha kar response dedega
ab yehi url humay app,js per bhi dena hoga middleware ke through(app.use)--->agar hum controller wager usi app.js ke ander write karte to app/get use karte but humne separate file banaye jiske liye middleware ki need hogi app.use--->(app.use("api/v1/users",userRouter)) 1st per api/v1/users hit hogi then userRouterper jayega usko controller dega phir wahan last scenario hoga already explained
NOTE:
export default means  (export default router) jab bhi hum karte hay to means we can import with any our name like this (import userRouter from "./routes/user.routes.js";)
and if we export with certain name without default then we need to import with that name
